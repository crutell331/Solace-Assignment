## If I had more time, here's what I'd do next

### **Higher Priority:**
- Add unit tests, especially for API
- Improve API error handling (ie status codes, case-specific error messages)
- Ability to order certain columns by asc/desc
- Ability to scope search to specific categories

### **Lower Priority:**
- Ability to change number of records per page
- Advocate show page

## Added Context
- 3 available PRs opened agains `main` branch
- Branches are scoped to specific category of improvements and created in this order: 1. Frontend, 2. Backend, 3. Styling
- `styling_improvements` branch includes all changes
