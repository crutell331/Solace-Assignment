## If I had more time, here's what I'd do next

## Higher Priority:
- Add unit tests, especially for API
- Improve API error handling (ie status codes, case-specific error messages)
- Ability to order certain columns by asc/desc
- Ability to scope search to specific categories

## Lower Priority:
- Ability to change number of records per page
- Advocate show page
